# README Update Instructions

## Objective
Update the `README.md` file for the awesome-single-cut-guitars repository to maintain consistent formatting and organization.

## Required Actions

### 1. Sort Brands Alphabetically
- Sort all entries in both the main "Listing" table and the "Guitar Boutiques" table by brand name in alphabetical order
- Ignore articles like "The" and brackets when sorting (e.g., "[Gibson]" should sort under "G")
- Maintain all existing data (links, models, countries, finishes) while reordering

### 2. Add Country Flags
- Add emoji flags to all country names in both the "Country" and "Made in" columns
- Use the appropriate flag emoji before the country name (e.g., "ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ USA", "ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Japan")
- For entries with multiple countries, add flags for each country (e.g., "ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Japan, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ China")

### Flag Reference
Common flags to use:
- ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ USA
- ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ China  
- ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Japan
- ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª Germany
- ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ Canada
- ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· France
- ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ UK
- ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º Hungary
- ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® Finland
- ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ Ukraine
- ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· South Korea
- ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡© Indonesia

### 3. Data Integrity
- Preserve all existing information (brand names, links, model names, finish types)
- Maintain proper markdown table formatting
- Keep the table headers and structure intact
- Ensure all links remain functional

### 4. Quality Checks
- Verify alphabetical sorting is correct
- Confirm all countries have appropriate flags
- Check that table formatting is consistent
- Ensure no data is lost during the update

### 5. Entry Uniqueness Validation
- **Check for duplicate brand entries** across both tables
- **Verify no brand appears multiple times** with different information
- **Identify similar or variant brand names** that might be the same company:
  - Different spellings (e.g., "Gibson" vs "Gibson Guitars")
  - Subsidiary relationships (e.g., "Epiphone" owned by Gibson)
  - Different divisions of the same company
- **Actions for duplicate entries:**
  - **Exact duplicates**: Remove the duplicate, keep the most complete entry
  - **Same brand, different models**: Consolidate into single entry with all models listed
  - **Same brand, different countries**: Research to determine correct information
  - **Subsidiary brands**: Keep separate but ensure clarity (e.g., note ownership)
- **Cross-table validation**: Ensure brands aren't listed in both "Listing" and "Guitar Boutiques" tables
- **Model uniqueness**: Within each brand entry, ensure model names aren't duplicated

### 6. URL Validation
- **Test all website URLs** to ensure they are valid and accessible
- Verify that each link points to the correct guitar brand's official website
- Check for the following issues:
  - **Broken links** (404 errors, domain not found)
  - **Redirects** that lead to unrelated sites
  - **HTTPS vs HTTP** issues
  - **Websites that are down** or temporarily unavailable
- **Actions for problematic URLs:**
  - If a website is permanently down: Remove the link but keep the brand name
  - If a URL has changed: Update to the new correct URL
  - If a website is temporarily down: Note it for later re-checking
  - If redirected to a different domain: Verify it's the official new site
- **Tools for URL checking:**
  - Manual browser testing
  - Online link checkers
  - Command line tools (curl, wget)
  - Browser extensions for bulk link checking

### 7. URL Format Standards
- Ensure all URLs use HTTPS when available
- Remove unnecessary parameters (tracking codes, etc.)
- Use clean, direct links to the brand's main page or guitar section
- Format URLs consistently without trailing slashes unless required

## Example Format
```markdown
|[Brand Name](https://example.com/)|ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ USA|ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ USA|Model Name|Finish Type|
```

## Notes
- Both tables should be updated: main "Listing" and "Guitar Boutiques"
- If a brand has incomplete country information, research and fill in missing data when possible
- Maintain the existing table structure and column order
- **Priority**: URL validation should be done regularly (quarterly or when adding new entries) to maintain link quality
- **Priority**: Entry uniqueness should be checked every time new brands are added to prevent duplicates
